<h1>Shared Support Resources</h1>

<p>
These materials are part of a <b>publicly shared collection of practical support and learning resources</b> used by families, educators, peer supporters, and community members.
</p>

<p>
They are <b>independently developed and freely accessible</b> so they can be used without cost, registration, or coordination.
</p>

<div class="notice">
If you arrived here before seeing an example, this page explains what the materials are and why they are shared.
</div>

<h2>What These Resources Help With</h2>

<p>
These materials are designed to help <b>ordinary people handle difficult real-life human situations more safely and calmly.</b>
</p>

<p>
They are especially used when someone notices a person who may be <b>overwhelmed, withdrawn, distressed, or struggling</b> but does not know how to approach them without making things worse.
</p>

<p><b>The goal is not counseling and not intervention.</b></p>

<p>The goal is:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>noticing early signs</b></li>
<li><b>responding gently</b></li>
<li><b>avoiding escalation</b></li>
<li><b>knowing when to step back</b></li>
<li><b>helping without pressure or harm</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
They function as a <b>small guided rehearsal for real-world moments</b> that families, educators, peer supporters, and community members regularly encounter.
</p>

<h2>Why They Are Freely Shared</h2>

<p>
The materials are maintained by an individual living with a disability. Because traditional payments can interfere with disability benefits, they are shared publicly instead of sold.
</p>

<p>
Support, when people choose to give it, is handled separately through a disability savings program and is never required to use the materials.

<p>
These resources are shared for educational and supportive purposes only.  
They are not therapy, crisis services, or professional advice.
</p>

<p>
If someone may be in immediate danger, contact local emergency or crisis services.
